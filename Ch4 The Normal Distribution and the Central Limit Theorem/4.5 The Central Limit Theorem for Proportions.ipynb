    "A **population proportion** is the fraction, ratio, or percentage of the population that possesses a certain characteristic. For example, in 2006, the **proportion** of adult Americans that were married was $55.7\\%$. Note a few important properties about proportions:\n",
    " \n",
    "- For each member of the population, there are only two options: either the member possesses the characteristic or the member doesn't possess the characteristic. In the above example, since $55.7\\%$ of U.S. adults were married in 2006, we can conclude that $100\\% - 55.7\\% = 44.3\\%$ of U.S. adults were not married in 2006.\n",
    "- The value of a proportion is always between $0$ and $1$. In the above example, the proportion $55.7\\% = 0.557$ lies between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "- A proportion is the probability that, if we randomly select a member of the population, that the selected member will possess the characteristic. In the example above, if we were to randomly select an adult in the year 2006, there is a $55.7\\%$ chance that the selected adult would be married.\n",

    "A population proportion $p$ is calculated using the formula\n",

We do not even need to know *how* the population is distributed.

But in practice, as long as the sample size $n$ is large enough so that $np \\geq 5$ and $n(1-p) \\geq 5$, the distribution of sample proportions approximates the normal distribution so closely that we can treat the distribution as if it is normally distributed.\n",
    "- We call the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, $\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$, the **standard error** to distinguish it from the standard deviation of a population.\n",
    "- Note that the larger the sample size $n$ is, the smaller the standard error $\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ becomes. That is, sample proportions from larger samples will tend to better approximate the population proportion than sample proportions from smaller samples.\n",

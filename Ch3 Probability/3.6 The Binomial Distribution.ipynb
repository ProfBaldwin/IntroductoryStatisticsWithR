    "- There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter $n$ denotes the number of trials. <br/><br/> For example, if we conduct a binomial experiment by rolling a six-sided die ten times, then the binomial experiment has $n = 10$ trials.<br/><br/>\n",
    "- There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter $p$ denotes the probability of a success for one trial, and $q$ denotes the probability of a failure for one trial. Since \"success\" and \"failure\" are complementary outcomes, $p + q = 1$. <br/><br/> Imagine we roll a six-sided die ten times, and we want to know many twos we roll. Then each of the $n = 10$ trials is counted a \"success\" when we roll a two and is a \"failure\" when we roll anything that isn't a two. In this case, the probability a trial is a success is $p = \\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability a trial is a failure is $q = \\frac{5}{6}$. (Note, $p + q = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} = 1$.)<br/><br/>\n",
    "- The $n$ trials of a binomial experiment are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the $n$ trials are independent and identical, the probability of success $p$ and probability of failure $q$ are the same for each trial. <br/><br/> In our binomial experiment of $n = 10$ die rolls, we have a probabiliy of $p = \\frac{1}{6}$ of rolling a two on the second trial no matter what happened during the first trial. The probability of success and the probability of failure is the same for every roll of the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a **binomial probability distribution**, which is a special kind of discrete probability distribution. A binomial distribution is a formula that gives the probability that there were exactly $x$ successes in the $n$ trials, where we can choose any whole number $x$  between $0$ and $n$.\n",

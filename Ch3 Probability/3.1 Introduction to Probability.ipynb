    "## Experiments, Outcomes, and Events\n",
    "Before we consider probability, we first must define a few key terms. To begin, it will be useful to focus on activities that can be repeated and where all the possible outcomes are known. These kinds of activities are called **experiments**. For example, flipping a fair coin is an experiment because it can be repeated (we can flip the coin again), and all the possible outcomes are known (the coin will land on either heads or tails). Another example of an experiment is drawing two cards from a standard 52 card deck because it can be repeated (we can return the two cards to the deck, shuffle, then take two new cards from the deck) and we know all the possible outcomes (since we know which cards are in the deck, we know all the cards that might be drawn).\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, we define an **outcome** of an experiment as a possible result of the experiment. Before an experiment takes place, there may be several possible outcomes that have a chance of happening. But after the experiment has concluded, exactly one outcome has happened. For example, if you toss a coin, the coin may come up heads or tails—two possible outcomes. But once the coin has landed, the coin has either come up heads or come up tails—exactly one outcome has actually occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sample space** of an experiment is the **set** or collection of all possible outcomes. The uppercase letter $S$ is used to denote sample space. We can express the set of all possible outcomes using **set notation**: we list all the outcomes and enclose the list in curly brackets. For example, if you flip one fair coin, the sample space is $S = \\{H, T\\}$ where $H$ = Heads and $T$ = Tails are the outcomes. As another example, if you roll a six-sided die, the sample space is $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, where each number represents the side of the die that is face up.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is any combination of outcomes. We usually use upper case letters like $A$ and $B$ to represent events, and we use set notation to represent the outcomes in the event. For example, if the experiment is to roll a six-sided die, then let event $A$ be rolling an even number, and let event $B$ be rolling a number greater than $2$. In set notation, $A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. If the experiment results in *any* outcome in the event, then the event has happened. And note that while an experiment can have only one outcome, it can result in multiple events happening. For example, if we roll a $4$ with a six-sided die, then event $A$ has happened (since $4$ is an even number), *and* event $B$ has happened (since $4$ is a number greater than $2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to know how many outcomes are in an event. For any event $E$, we let $n(E)$ represent the number of outcomes in the event. Again, consider rolling a six-sided die, and let $D = \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$. There are four outcomes in event $D$, so $n(D) = 4$. Similarly, $n(S) = 6$ because $S$ is the entire sample space, and there are six possible outcomes total when rolling a six-sided die."

    "## Basic Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability** is a measure of how likely it is that some event occurs when an experiment is performed. For example, if we flip a fair coin, there is a $50\\%$ probability that the coin comes up heads and a $50\\%$ probability that the coin comes up tails. This means that the coin is equally as likely to come up heads as it is to come up tails. Probabilities are always between $0\\%$ and $100\\%$ because an event cannot have less than a $0\\%$ chance of happening or more than a $100\\%$ chance of happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is common to use percentages when speaking of probabilities, it is more convenient mathematically to express probabilities in decimal form. In decimal form, the probability that a flipped coin comes up heads is $0.5$ (since $0.5 = 50\\%$). Similarly, in decimal form, probabilities are always between $0$ and $1$. If a probability is in percentage form, it must first be converted to decimal form before it can be used in calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the probability of an event $E$ as $P(E)$. For example, if we toss a fair coin and $H = $ the coin comes up heads, then $P(H) = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event tells us how often we would expect the event to occur if we repeated an experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0.25$, then we expect event $A$ to happen in $25\\%$ of the experiments if we repeated the experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0.672$, then we expect event $A$ to happen in $67.2\\%$ of the experiments if we repeated the experiment many times. If $P(A) = 0$, then event $A$ will happen in $0\\%$ of the experiments; that is, event $A$ will never be the result of an experiment. If $P(A) = 1$, then event $A$ will happen in $100\\%$ of the experiments; that is, event $A$ will happen in every experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The more times you conduct an experiment, the more likely it is that the proportion of times an event occurs will be close to the probability of the event. For example, if we tossed a coin just two times, we wouldn't be too surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses came up heads. If we tossed the coin five times, we'd be a little more surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses came up heads. But if we toss a coin $1,000$ times, we would be *very* surprised if $100\\%$ of the tosses come up heads. With $1,000$ tosses, we expect the proportion of tosses that come up heads to be much closer to the probability of $0.5 = 50\\%$. (See {numref}`Figure {number} <observed-coin-flips>`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the **law of large numbers** which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the proportion obtained in the experiments tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes of the experiments do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed proportion will approach the theoretical probability."

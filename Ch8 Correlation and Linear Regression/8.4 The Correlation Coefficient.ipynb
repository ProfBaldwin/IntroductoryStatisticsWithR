    "The correlation coefficient has many useful properties:\n",
    "- The value of $r$ is always between -1 and +1: $-1 \\leq r \\leq 1$.\n",
    "- The size of the correlation coefficient $r$ indicates the strength of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Values of $r$ close to -1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "- If $r = 0$ there is likely no linear correlation. (However, it is important to view the scatterplot, as the data may exhibit a non-linear correlation.)\n",
    "- If $r = 1$, there is perfect positive correlation. If $r = –1$, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie exactly on a straight line. Of course, in the real world, this will not generally happen.\n",
    "- A positive value of $r$ means that the slope of the line of best fit is positive. In this case, we say the variables appear to be **positively correlated**.\n",

    "We want to perform a hypothesis test on the significance of a correlation coefficient to decide whether the linear relationship in the sample data is strong enough to use to model the relationship in the population. The correlation coefficient, $r$, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. However, the reliability of the linear model also depends on how many observed data points are in the sample. To determine if a linear model accurately reflects the relationship in a population, we need to look at both the value of the correlation coefficient $r$ and the sample size $n$, together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we would like to test the significance of the population correlation coefficient, denoted by $\\rho$ (the Greek letter \"rho\"), using the sample correlation coefficient, $r$. If the evidence from the sample data is strong enough to suggest that $\\rho \\neq 0$, then we can conclude that the population is linearly correlated; otherwise, the evidence is not sufficient to reject the null hypothesis that $\\rho = 0$, and we cannot conclude that the population is linearly correlated.\n",

    "$$ t = \\frac{r \\sqrt{n - 2}}{\\sqrt{1 - r^2}}. $$\n",

    "Once we have the $p$-value, we compare it to the level of significance $\\alpha$ and draw our conclusion as normal:\n",

    "In this type of hypothesis test, we determine whether the data *\"fit\"* a particular discrete distribution or not. For example, we may suspect the unknown data fit a binomial distribution. We use a goodness-of-fit test to determine if there is a fit or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- $O$ = observed values (sample data)\n",
    "- $E$ = expected values (from theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed values are the data values from the sample. The expected values are the values we would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true. The sampling distribution of the test statistic is a $\\chi^2$-distribution. The number of degrees of freedom of the distribution is $df = k - 1$, where $k$ is the number of different categories in the hypothesized discrete distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the hypotheses of a goodness-of-fit test are\n",

    "A goodness-of-fit test is almost always right-tailed. The further apart observed values and expected values are from each other, the further out in the right tail the test statistic will be. (A left-tailed goodness of fit test would test if the observed values fit the expected values too well, which is not generally something we are concerned with.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a goodness-of-fit test to be valid, the expected value for each category needs to be at least five.\n",

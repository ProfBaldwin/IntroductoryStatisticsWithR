    "## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Sometimes we want to test whether a claim made about a population parameter is true or not. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck averages $35$ miles per gallon. A tutoring service claims that $90\\%$ of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $\\$53{,}000$ per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often impractical to survey every member of a population to confirm a claim or **hypothesis**. Instead, we can sample a few members of the population and calculate a point estimate of the parameter we are interested in. If the hypothesis is true, we would expect the point estimate to be close to the hypothesized value of the parameter. So if the point estimate is actually far away from the hypothesized value of the parameter, we might conclude that the actual value of the parameter is different from the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose Julian claims his average time for the $100$-meter dash is $11.72$ seconds. We can test the hypothesis that this parameter, the population mean, is $\\mu = 11.72$ seconds. Imagine we sample several of his runs and calculate a sample mean of $\\bar{x} = 11.77$ seconds. Since the point estimate $\\bar{x} = 11.77$ seconds is so close to Julian's claimed mean time of $\\mu = 11.72$ seconds, we would probably feel that Julian's claim is about right. But if, instead, we obtained a sample mean of $\\bar{x} = 13.45$ seconds, this sample mean would be so far from Julian's claim of $\\mu = 11.72$ seconds that we might seriously doubt his claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we tell exactly when a point estimate is far enough from a hypothesized parameter that we should reject that hypothesis? To do this, we first calculate the sampling distribution of the point estimate *assuming the hypothesis is true*. Using the sampling distribution, we determine the theoretical probability of randomly selecting a sample with a point estimate at least as far from the parameter as the point estimate obtained from the actual sample. If it is exceptionally unlikely that we would have randomly selected a sample with a point estimate so far from the hypothesized parameter, we can conclude with some confidence that the hypothesis is probably not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the fundamental steps to a **hypothesis test** are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Gather a random sample.**<br/>Consider this \"step zero\": before we conduct a hypothesis test, we need a point estimate from sample data to compare to the hypothesized parameter. In the real world, statisticians must carefully gather a random sample from the population to be able to perform a hypothesis test. In this text, we will generally be given the sample data in the problem statement, so we won't need to gather a sample ourselves.\n",
    "1. **State the hypothesis.**<br/>Identify a claim about a population parameter that we want to test, and state the hypothesis mathematically.\n",
    "2. **Assuming the hypothesis is true, identify the sampling distribution.**<br/>In this chapter, we will focus on hypotheses about the population mean or population proportion. We use the central limit theorem to identify the sampling distributions of the point estimates of these parameters.\n",
    "3. **Find the probability.**<br/>Using the sampling distribution, we calculate the probability that the point estimate from a random sample is at least as far from the hypothesized parameter as the point estimate from the actual sample is.\n",
    "4. **Draw a conclusion.**<br/>If the probability of obtaining our point estimate is very small, we might conclude that our assumption, that the hypothesis is true, is actually not correct. On the other hand, if the probability is not small, we would not have a good argument to reject the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will formalize these ideas in the coming chapter and return to them throughout the rest of the course. For now, let's go over a few examples focusing on the big idea and the fundamental components."

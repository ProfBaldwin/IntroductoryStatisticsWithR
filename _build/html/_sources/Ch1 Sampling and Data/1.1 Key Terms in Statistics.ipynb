    "## The Definition of Statistics\n",
    "The science of **statistics** deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of **data**. We see and use data in our everyday lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this text, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called **descriptive statistics**. There are many ways to summarize data. For example, graphing is one way to summarize data. We can also use numbers to summarize data; for example, we could calculate the average value of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, after you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from \"good\" data. These formal methods are called **inferential statistics**. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for obtaining data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life."

    "## Key Terms\n",
    "In statistics, we generally want to study a **population**. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a **sample**. The idea of **sampling** is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that smaller portion (the sample) to infer information about the population.\n",

    "A sample of four individuals is chosen from a population of twelve individuals.[^attribution]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because it usually takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. For example:\n",
    "- During a national election, it is impossible for a pollster to survey all the millions of voters in the country. Instead, the pollster will sample only a few hundred voters from the population. The opinions expressed by those sampled in the survey (hopefully) represent the views of voters in the entire country.\n",
    "- An ice cream manufacturer wouldn't want to taste-test every carton of ice cream produced to ensure its quality because the testing process would ruin the ice cream. Instead, the manufacturer could taste-test a sample of ice cream cartons. If any quality control issues are present in the ice cream cartons sampled, it may indicate there are problems in the larger population.\n",

    "An advertising company has created two ads for an American restaurant chain, one featuring a burger and one featuring a salad. They want to know which of the two ads Americans would find more appealing. To find out, the advertising company surveys $50$ people and asks them which of the two ads they prefer.

    "We sample a population so we can estimate a population **parameter**. A parameter is a number that summarizes the characteristics of a population. Because it can be difficult to study an entire population, we often cannot find the exact value of a parameter. Instead, we estimate the population parameter by calculating a sample **statistic**. A statistic is a number that summarizes the characteristics of a sample. A statistic is easier to calculate than a parameter because we only need to study a sample—not the entire population—to calculate a statistic. We can use a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean** of a population (commonly referred to as the **average** of a population) is one example of a parameter. For example, suppose we want to find the mean age of people living in California. Since it is difficult to find the age of every person in California, we could sample just a few Californians and calculate the mean age of the sample. We can use this statistic—the mean age of the Californians sampled—to estimate the parameter—the mean age of all Californians. For instance, if the average age of Californians in our sample is 35.2 years old, we would estimate that the average age of all Californians is about 35.2 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **proportion** of a population is another example of a parameter. The proportion of the population is the fraction of the population that possesses some characteristic. We can express proportions as fractions, percents, or decimals. For example, suppose on your way to school you counted $50$ cars, $8$ of which were red. So in your sample of $50$ cars, the proportion of red cars is $\\frac{8}{50}$. (As a percent, this proportion is $16\\%$. As a decimal, it is $0.16$.) We can use this statistic from our sample of $50$ cars to estimate the proportion of the population of all cars that are red; that is, we estimate that around $16\\%$ of all cars are red.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of a hypothesized population parameter.\n",

    "The first letter of *parameter* and the first letter of *statistic* will help you remember in which setting each word is used. A **p**arameter summarizes characteristics of a **p**opulation. A **s**tatistic summarizes characteristics of a **s**ample.\n",

    "To calculate a sample statistic, we must gather information from each member sampled. A **variable** is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables are usually denoted by campital letters such as $X$ or $Y$. To calculate a sample statistic, we must gather **data** corresponding to the variable we are studying from each member sampled. The data are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. A **data point** or **datum** is a single data value. For example:\n",

    "Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your town. You might look in the classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed, and average them together. You would have obtained a **point estimate** of the true mean. If you are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting a basketball, you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you attempted. In this case, you would have obtained a **point estimate** for the true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of statistics is called **inferential statistics**. The sample data help us to make an estimate of a population parameter. We realize that the point estimate is most likely not the exact value of the population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we can construct a range of values, called a confidence interval, where we have a high confidence the population parameter falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **confidence interval** is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an interval of numbers. It provides a range of reasonable values in which we expect the population parameter to fall. There is no guarantee that a given confidence interval does capture the parameter, but there is a predictable probability of success."

    "To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population mean $\\mu$, **where the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known**, we need  to know $\\bar{x}$  and we need to know the **margin of error**, $E$. The sample mean $\\bar{x}$  is a **point estimate** of the unknown population mean $\\mu$. It is a single value or point that estimates the population parameter. The margin of error is a measure of how far $\\bar{x}$ might be from $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (\\text{point estimate} - \\text{margin of error},\\ \\text{point estimate} + \\text{margin of error}), $$\n",

    "\n",
    "We say $\\bar{x} - E$ is the **lower bound** of the confidence interval, and $\\bar{x} + E$ is the **upper bound** of the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error, $E$, depends on the **confidence level** (abbreviated $\\text{CL}$). The confidence level is often considered the probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. However, it is more accurate to state that the confidence level is the percent of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter when repeated samples are taken. Most often, the person constructing the confidence interval chooses a confidence level of $90\\%$ or higher because that person wants to be reasonably certain of their conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another probability, $\\alpha$ (the Greek letter *alpha*) is the probability that the interval does not contain the unknown population parameter. Mathematically, $\\alpha + \\text{CL} = 1.$"

    "### Example 5.1.1\n",
    "Suppose we have sample data collected from a population. Imagine we've already found that the sample mean is $\\bar{x} = 7$ and that the margin of error is $E = 2.5$ for a confidence level of $\\text{CL} = 95\\%$. The population mean is unkown. Construct a confidence interval for the population mean.\n",

    "A confidence interval for a population mean $\\mu$ with a known standard deviation $\\sigma$ is based on the fact that the sample means follow an approximately normal distribution. Recall that by the central limit theorem, this sampling distribution is distributed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real-world scenarios, we generally do not know the population mean $\\mu$, which is also the mean of the sampling distribution. If we did know $\\mu$, we would have no need to estimate it by calculating a confidence interval. So we approximate the population mean $\\mu$ with the point estimate $\\bar{x}$. By making this substitution, the distribution becomes\n",

    "This is a good question. Generally, if we do not know the mean of a population, we would *not* expect to know the standard deviation of the population. However, it turns out approximating $\\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $s$ in the sampling distribution formulas is more delicate and more complicated than approximating $\\mu$ with $\\bar{x}$. In a future section, we will learn how to use $s$ instead of $\\sigma$ in the calculation. For now, since we are just beginning to learn about confidence intervals, we make the somewhat unrealistic assumption that we know the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ but not the population mean $\\mu$ in order to simplify the calculation.\n",

We sample $n = 35$ members of the population and calculate a sample mean of $\\bar{x} = 52$. We want to construct a $90\\%$ confidence interval for the population mean. To get a $90\\%$ confidence interval, we must include the central $90\\%$ of the probability of the normal distribution. If we include the central $90\\%$, we leave out a total of $\\alpha = 10\\%$ in both tails of the normal distribution, or $\\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 5\\%$ in each tail."

    "In the previous chapter, we learned how we test a claim about the mean or the proportion of a population. The process for testing a claim about the variance of a population is very similar. \n",

    "Recall that the **variance** of a population is simply the square of the population standard deviation; that is, if $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, then $\\sigma^2$ is the population variance. While the variance and the standard deviation are not quite the same, the two parameters both measure how far data is from the mean. Testing the population variance is the same as testing the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike hypothesis tests for the population mean or the population proportion, we do not directly use a point estimate when testing the population variance. Instead, we use a **test statistic**. A test statistic is a quantity that summarizes the data in a sample and can be used in hypothesis testing. The $z$-scores and $t$-scores we calculated when testing population means and population proportions in the previous chapter are test statistics.\n",

    "A beverage company wants to make sure that the amount of soda in their two-liter bottles doesn't differ significantly bottle-to-bottle.

The quality control division of the company carefully measures the amount of soda in $13$ bottles and obtains the following results (in milliliters):\n",

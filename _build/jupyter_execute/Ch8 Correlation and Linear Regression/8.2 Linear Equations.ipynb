    "For the linear equation $y = a + bx$, the point $(0, a)$ is the **$y$-intercept** of the line, and $b$ is the **slope** of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $y$-intercept $(0, a)$ of a line is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. In applications, it often represents a starting value or initial value of $y = a$ when $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of a line describes the steepness and direction of the line. The larger the absolute value of slope $b$, the steeper the line. If $b$ is positive, the line has an \"uphill\" slope from left to right. If $b$ is negative, the line has a \"downhill\" slope from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the variables, a positive slope ($b > 0$) means that as the value of $x$ gets bigger, the value of $y$ gets bigger, too. Conversely, a negative slope ($b < 0$) means that as the value of $x$ gets bigger, the value of $y$ gets smaller. A line with zero slope ($b = 0$) means $x$ can get bigger or smaller, but $y$ always stays exactly the same."

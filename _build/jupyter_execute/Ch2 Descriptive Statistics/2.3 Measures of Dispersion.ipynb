If $x$ is a data value, then the difference \"$x – \\text{mean}$\" is called its **deviation**; it's a measure of the distance from the value $x$ to the mean of the data. There is a deviation for each value in a data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. For a population, the deviation for a data value $x$ is $x – \\mu$.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$x - \\mu = 8 - 5 = 3.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $x = 2$ and $x = 8$ are a distance of $3$ units away from $\\mu = 5$. But the signs (positives or negatives) of the deviations also tell us direction: since the deviation of $x = 2$ is $-3$, $x = 2$ is $3$ units *below* the mean; since the deviation of $x = 8$ is $+3$, $x = 8$ is $3$ units *above* the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the standard deviation, we want to only focus on the average distance from the mean, not the direction. To remove the information on direction (the sign) from each deviation, we square each deviation. For $x = 2$, the squared deviation is\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ (x - \\mu)^2 = (8 - 5)^2 = 3^2 = 9. $$\n",

    "Since squaring a deviation always results in a positive number, it removes the information on direction. Unfortunately, squared deviations tell us the *square* of the distance of each value from the mean, not simply the distance. We will correct this problem later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we find the mean of all the squared deviations in the usual way: by adding up all the squared deviations in the population and dividing by the population size $N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\sum(x - \\mu)^2}{N}. $$\n",

But the most significant difference is that the when calculating the sample standard deviation, we divide by *one less* than the number of data values: $n - 1$.

The sample standard deviation uses the distances from each value to the *sample* mean in its calculation: $(x - \\bar{x})$. We want the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation, but the population standard deviation averages the distances from each value to the *population* mean: $(x - \\mu)$. The sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is usually close to $\\mu$, but they are rarely the same. Because of this small difference in what is being calculated, we need a small correction to the formula. Using techniques that are more advanced than what we will cover in this text, statisticians can show that dividing by $n - 1$ instead of $n$ corrects this bias.\n",

    "## Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers** are data values that deviate from the mean much greater than the standard amount for the data. Statisticians are interested in identifying outliers because they may indicate an error in the data. For example, suppose we collect the following data for the price of a cup of coffee at several local coffee shops:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    2.69, 2.79, 2.99, 3.00, 2.69, 3.15, 2.89, 2.69, 2.90, <b>259</b>, 2.79, 2.80, 3.10, 2.59, 2.75\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The value in bold is a clear outlier. It seems extremely unlikely that this cup of coffee actually cost \\$259. Instead, the data value may have been recorded incorrectly, so that the true cost for this cup of coffee was \\$2.59, not \\$259.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different methods statisticians use to calculate outliers depending on the distribution of the data they are working with. We will learn one simple rule often used for detecting outliers. We will consider a data value an outlier if it is more than two standard deviations away from the mean. In mathematical notation, this means a data value is an outlier in a population if it is more than $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ or less than $\\mu - 2\\sigma$. In a sample, a data value is an outlier if it is more than $\\bar{x} + 2s$ or less than $\\bar{x} - 2s$. This is a reasonable definition because the average distance between data values and their mean is one standard deviation, so most data values lie within a distance of two standard deviations from their mean. Only relatively extreme data values are more than two standard deviations away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is more a \"rule of thumb\" than a rigid law. Professional statisticians may use different rules to identify outliers depending on the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, just because a value is an outlier does not mean there is anything wrong with it. While some outliers may be the result of errors, other outliers may be perfectly valid data values that are just unusually large or small. You should determine whether outliers are valid on a case-by-case basis."

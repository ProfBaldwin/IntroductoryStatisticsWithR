    "After identifying the hypotheses for a hypothesis test, we calculate the point estimate from the sample data. Next, we calculate the probability that, if the null hypothesis is true, the point estimate from a randomly selected sample would be at least as extreme as the point estimate we obtained from the given sample. This probability is called the **$p$-value** of the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small $p$-value means that, if the null hypothesis is true, there is only a small probability of getting the point estimate we do. The smaller the $p$-value, the more unlikely the outcome we get. If this probability is unlikely enough, we may conclude that it is more reasonably to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $p$-value is not small, we may conclude that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if the $p$-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis? A systematic way to make a decision of whether or not to reject the null hypothesis is to compare the $p$-value to a predetermined **level of significance**, denoted by $\\alpha$ (the Greek letter \"alpha\"). The level of significance $\\alpha$ is probability that the hypothesis test results in a type I error. In this textbook, the value of $\\alpha$ will always be given at the beginning of each problem. Real statisticians must themselves choose a value for $\\alpha$ appropriate to each particular problem. A choice of $\\alpha = 5\\% = 0.05$ is a common choice for real-life hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the $p$-value $< \\alpha$ then reject $H_0$. The results from the sample data are significant. There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ and conclude that the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is correct.\n",
    "- If the $p$-value $\\geq \\alpha$ then do not reject $H_0$. The results from the sample data are not significant. There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ and conclude that the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is correct.\n",

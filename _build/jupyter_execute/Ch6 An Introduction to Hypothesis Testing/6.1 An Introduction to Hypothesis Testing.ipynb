    "## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Sometimes we want to test whether a claim made about a population parameter is true or not. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck averages $35$ miles per gallon. A tutoring service claims that $90\\%$ of its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an average of $\\$53{,}000$ per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often impractical to survey every member of a population to confirm a claim or **hypothesis**. Instead, statisticians sample a few members of the population and calculate a point estimate of the parameter they are interested in. Then they use the central limit theorem to determine how likely it is to randomly select a sample with that particular point estimate *assuming the hypothesis is true*. If it is exceptionally unlikely to get the point estimate that actually obtained if the hypothesis were true, we can conclude with some confidence that the claim is probably not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the fundamental components to a **hypothesis test** are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to test if a claim about a population parameter is true.\n",
    "2. We randomly sample members of the population to find a point estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "3. Assuming the claim about the population parameter *is* true, we use the central limit theorem to determine the probability of obtaining the point estimate of our random sample.\n",
    "4. If the probability of obtaining the point estimate is exceptionally small, we reject the claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will formalize these ideas in the coming chapter and return to them throughout the rest of the course. For now, let's go over a few examples focusing on the big idea and the fundamental components."

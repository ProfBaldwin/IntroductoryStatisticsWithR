    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to find the average hourly wage of workers in Brazil. There are millions of workers in Brazil, so we can't practically survey all Brazilian workers to find the true population mean of their hourly wages. Instead, we can approximate the population mean by surveying a random sample of, say, $500$ Brazilian workers and calculating the mean of this smaller sample. This sample mean would probably not be *exactly* equal to the population mean, but the sample mean would likely be a good *approximation* of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our random sample of $500$ Brazilian workers is only one particular sample of many random samples that are possible. Because there are millions of Brazilian workers, there are many possible ways a sample of $500$ Brazilian workers might be randomly chosen. For instance, if we were to collect a second random sample of $500$ Brazilian workers, this second sample would almost certainly include $500$ different workers than those workers which were selected for our first sample. The sample mean from this new second sample would probably be a little different than the sample mean from our first sample, though both sample means would probably give a good approximation of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've imagined taking just two different samples of $500$ Brazilian workers from the population. Now imagine *all* the possible ways we can sample $500$ Brazilian workers from the population. How would the different sample means from all those samples be distributed? Well, like with the two sample means we considered above, we would expect most of the possible sample means to be close to the population mean. In fact, the further we get from the population mean, the fewer sample means we will to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is *possible* that in random sample of $500$ Brazilian workers, just by chance, all $500$ workers are extremely well-paid. The sample mean of this sample would be considerably higher than the population mean since we only sampled well-paid workers. However, though it is *possible* to randomly select a sample like this, it is *extremely unlikely*. The vast majority of possible samples would include workers at a variety of income levels. Only a very small proportion of samples would have a sample mean as far from the population mean as in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the distribution of sample means taken from the possible random samples of a population the **sampling distribution** of the sample mean. From the above discussion, we expect the sampling distribution to be distributed like a bell curve, with most sample means clustered near the population mean, and few samples means far from the population mean."

    "Let $X$ be a random variable for a population with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. Let $\\bar{X}$ be the random variable of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for this population, where the samples are of size $n$. If the sample size $n$ is big enough (so that $n \\geq 30$), then the sampling distribution is roughly a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. That is,\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several important observations about this theorem that we should note:\n",
    "- The central limit theorem does not make any requirements on how the population is distributed. This is why the central limit theorem is so powerful. The population can have any distribution. We do not even need to know *how* the population is distributed. No matter how the population is distributed, the sampling distribution of sample means (with $n \\geq 30$) will approximate a normal distribution.\n",
    "- The theorem states that the distribution of sample means $\\bar{X}$ only *approximates* a normal distribution. But in practice, as long as the sample size $n \\geq 30$, the distribution of sample means approximates the normal distribution so closely that we can treat the distribution as if it is normally distributed. (In the special case that the population is also normally distributed, we can drop the requirement that $n \\geq 30$. If the population is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution will also be normally distributed for any sample size $n$.)\n",
    "- The standard deviation of the population, $\\sigma$, is different from the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. To distringuish between the standard deviations of the two different distributions, we call $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ the **standard error**.\n",
    "- Note that the larger the sample size $n$ is, the smaller the standard error $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ becomes. That is, sample means from larger samples will tend to better approximate the population mean than sample means from smaller samples.\n",
    "- The central limit theorem only applies for samples that are randomly selected. If a sample is not selected randomly, the central limit theorem may not apply.\n",

    "In the previous section, we learned that if we have a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, the formulas\n",

In particular, we use $\\bar{x}$ instead of $x$ (since we are dealing with the distribution of sample means, not particular values of the population), and we use the standard error $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ instead of the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ (since the standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution).

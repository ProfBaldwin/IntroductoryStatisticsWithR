    "We apporach graphs for quantitative data similarly, though with a few important distinctions. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, with quantitative data, it is often up to the statistician how to group or categorize the data. For example, if we are gathering data on eye color (qualitative data), we naturally have a category of blue eyes and a category of brown eyes; there is no opportunity to adjust the categories. But if we are gathering data on the heights of adult males (quantitative data), the statistician could partition the data so they get a group of individuals 50-59 inches tall, or they could partition the data so they get a group of individuals 50-54 inches tall and another group of individuals 55-59 inches tall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can measure how far apart quantitative data is. It doesn't make sense to ask how far apart blue eyes are from brown eyes. But it does make sense to ask how far apart 50 inches is from 59 inches. (They are 59 - 50 = 9 inches apart.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to visualize quantitative data is to use a histogram. A **histogram** is similar to a bar chart, but it is better at displaying quantitative data. Unlike a bar chart, a histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes so there is no gap between the bars. This helps emphasize the \"distance\" between quantitative data. A histogram has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The vertical axis is labeled either frequency or relative frequency (or percent frequency or probability). The histogram can suggest shape of the data and can suggest where the center of the data is and how spread out the data is."

A student can purchase 1 book, or they can purchase 2 books, but they can't purchase 2.7 books.

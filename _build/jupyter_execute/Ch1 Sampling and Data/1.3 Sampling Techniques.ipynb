    "## Sampling and Bias\n",
    "Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we gather information about a sample of the population. **A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.** If the sample does not have the same characteristics as the population, the statistic may not be a good estimator for the parameter. When this happens, we say the sample statistic is **biased**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a pollster wants to find out if the United States population believes a college education is important for a successful career. If the pollster only samples college students, then we might expect the proportion of the sample that believes college is important to be higher than the proportion of the population that believes college is important. Because the sample (which includes only college students) does not have the same characteristics as the population (which includes college students, college graduates, those who have never been to college, etc.), the sample statistic probably isn't a good estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To try to make sure that the sample has the same characteristics as the population, most statisticians use various methods of **random sampling**. There are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. We describe some of the most common methods below."

    "\n",
    "To choose a **stratified sample**, divide the population into groups called strata, then randomly choose a **proportionate** number of members from each stratum. For example, if a certain stratum consists of 27% of the population, the sample should have 27% of its members taken from that strata. Usually, strata are chosen to guarantee that certain important characteristics of the population are present in the sample. For instance, imagine a pollster wants to make sure their sample accurately represents each ethnicity of the population. The pollster can do this using stratified sampling where the strata are the different ethnicities of the population. If the population is 13.4% African American and 5.9% Asian, then the pollster's stratified sample will be 13.4% African American and 5.9% Asian.\n",

From the table, we can see that the proportion of renters in this strata is 15.2% = 0.152. (Note, when performing mathematics with percentages, we must always first convert percentages to decimals.) Since the economist wants a sample of size 400, we simply multiply 0.152 by 400 to find the number of individuals we should sample from the strata."

    "## Convenience Sampling: A Method to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of sampling that is non-random is **convenience sampling**. Convenience sampling involves using results that are convenient and readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others. Because the outcome if often biased, convenience sampling should generally be avoided.\n",

    "For example, suppose Professor Baldwin chooses a six-student study group by conveniently choosing the six students sitting nearest to the front of the classroom. Note that Professor Baldwin's choice is *not* random: students who tend to sit at the back of the classroom did not have an equal chance of being chosen for the study group. The study group is also very likely to be biased: it is well established that students who sit at the front of the classroom tend to do better in the class, which means the study group is likely to have a higher proportion of students with high grades than the class as a whole."

    "## Sample Size and Variability\n",
    "When collecting a sample, the **sample size** is important. The larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample statistic will accurately approximate the population parameter. A random sample of 10 members of a population is less likely to give a good approximation of the population parameter than a random sample of 100 members. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. This **sample variability** is completely natural. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each use simple random sampling to sample 500 students. Doreen's sample will be different from Jung's sample. Neither sample is wrong, but purely by chance, Doreen will sample students that Jung doesn't sample, and Jung will sample students that Doreen doesn't sample. So we shouldn't be surprised if the students in Doreen's sample sleep an average of 7.38 hours per night, while the students in Jung's sample sleep an average of 7.41 hours per night. While the results are different, both statistics are likely a good approximation of the population average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample statistics (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other."

    "## Qualitative Data and Quantitative Data\n",
    "Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like  $x$  or  $y$ generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qualitative\n",
    "- Quantitative\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qualitative data** are the result of categorizing or describing attributes in a population. Qualitative data are also often called **categorical data**. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative data** are always numbers, and are often also called **numerical data**. Quantitative data are the result of **counting** or **measuring** attributes in a population. Weight, amount of money, pulse rate, and  thenumber of people living in your town are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either **discrete** or **continuous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data that are the result of counting are **quantitative discrete data**. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. It doesn't make sense to receive $1.25$ phone calls in a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that are not made up only of whole numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are **quantitative continuous data**. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. For example, if you record the duration in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, you might get values like $1.25$, $7.53$, or $11.00$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average of qualitative data like hair color or blood type."

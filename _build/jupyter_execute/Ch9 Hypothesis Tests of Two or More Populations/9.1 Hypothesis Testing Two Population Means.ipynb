    "## Hypothesis Test with Two Population Means\n",
    "In previous sections, we learned how to test the mean of a population in relation to a particular value. But sometimes, we want to compare the means of two different populations. For example, if we have one population with mean $\\mu_1$ and another population with mean $\\mu_2$, we might want to test if $\\mu_1$ is smaller than $\\mu_2$. The null and alternative hypotheses for this hypothesis test would be\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "H_0:\\ \\mu_1 \\geq \\mu_2, \\\\\n",
    "H_a:\\ \\mu_1 < \\mu_2.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way to write these hypotheses that will be more convenient for our purposes. If we subtract $\\mu_2$ from both sides of the inequalities, our hypotheses become\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "H_0:\\ \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\geq 0, \\\\\n",
    "H_a:\\ \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 < 0.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This second way to write these hypotheses is equivalent to the first way, but it allows us to focus on the difference in the population means rather than comparing them directly. This is useful because, to find the $p$-value for a hypothesis test like this, we are going to use the distribution of the random variable $D = \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n_1$ be the size of the sample drawn from population $1$, and let $n_2$ be the size of the sample drawn from population $2$. Recall from the central limit theorem that $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ are normally distributed as long as $n_1, n_2 \\geq 30$ or the underlying populations are normally distributed. It turns out that the random variable $D = \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$ is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ and standard error $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are the standard deviations of the respective populations. As with the central limit theorem, we still require here that either $n_1, n_2 \\geq 30$ or the underlying populations are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we almost never know $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ in practice. Instead, we approximate the population standard deviations with the sample standard deviations from the two samples, $s_1$ and $s_2$. In this case, the mean of the sampling distribution is\n",

    "$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are approximating the population standard deviations with sample standard deviations, we need to use a $t$-distribution to find the $p$-value instead of the standard normal distribution. The $t$-score is given by the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the degrees of freedom $df$ is the smaller of the values $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental steps for conducting a hypothesis test remain the same:\n",

    "1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
